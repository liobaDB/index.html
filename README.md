From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicyclic_gearing):

> **Epicyclic gearing** or **planetary gearing** is a gear system consisting of one or more outer gears, or *planet* gears, revolving about a central, or *sun* gear. â€¦ Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or *annulus*, which meshes with the planet gears.
